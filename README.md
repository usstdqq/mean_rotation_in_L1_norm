# mean_rotation_in_L1_norm


This package solves the problem of 'mean rotation'. Given a set of rotation matrices as input, mean rotation is then computed as output.

Please refer to the follow two papers for details:

[1] R. Hartley, K Aftab and J. Trumpf, L1 rotation averaging using the Weiszfeld algorithm, in CVPR 2011
[2] Y. Dai, J. Trumpf, H. Li, N. Barnes and R. Hartley, Rotation Averaging with Application to Camera-Rig Calibration, in ACCV 2009

The Matlab source code is provided, please make sure these two Matlab functions quat2dcm and dcm2quat, which make transfers between rotation matrix and quaternion, are available to you. Also please read the above two papers before come to me for help.
